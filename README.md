# Neural Network from Scratch for MNIST Digit Classification

This project implements a **fully connected neural network from scratch**, using only **NumPy**, to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates core machine learning principles like **forward propagation**, **backpropagation**, and **gradient descent**, without relying on any ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features

- Built a 2-layer neural network entirely from scratch using NumPy
- Achieved **85% accuracy** on the MNIST dataset
- Implemented:
  - ReLU and softmax activations
  - One-hot encoding for label representation
  - Manual forward and backward propagation
  - Weight and bias updates using gradient descent

## Learning Rate Strategy

To accelerate early learning:
- Initially set the **learning rate `alpha = 0.15`** (higher than the standard 0.10)
- Applied a **learning rate decay strategy** where:
  - The learning rate **decreased gradually per iteration**
  - Eventually stabilized at **alpha = 0.10**
  
This helped the model learn quickly in the beginning without overshooting the optimal parameters during later training epochs.

## Dataset

- Used the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer)
- Preprocessed:
  - Flattened 28Ã—28 images into 784-length vectors
  - Normalized pixel values to range [0, 1]

## Training & Accuracy

- Reached 85%+ accuracy within 500 iterations on training data
- Monitored accuracy every 10 iterations
- Model performance was stable after ~400 iterations

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python and NumPy installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas

## ðŸ“š Inspiration

This project was based on the excellent tutorial by Samson Zhang (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t).

I improved the project by implementing the faster initial learning rate strategy
